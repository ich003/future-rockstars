## Development Progress

All development can be tracked on our public Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/sDJQagZ3/future-rockstars-python-project) and further information on our development progress and process can be found on this repository's wiki [here](https://github.com/thehouseplant/future-rockstars/wiki). 

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

[Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python 3.6.x is required to work
with this project, so please feel free to download the appropriate installer for your operating system. This will install Python and Pip, Python's package manager. 

virtualenv/pyvenv - We use this to create virtual environments in which to develop Python applications. Doing this allows us to install packages only for the specific project we are working on instead of globally. This can be installed
by running the following command in Command Prompt or a terminal: 

- `pip install virtualenv`

Now that those are both installed, we can move on to getting the application and environment setup

### Application Setup

First, we will want to clone this repository to our local machines. To do this, simply navigate to a directory that you store other projects in and run the following command in Command Prompt or a terminal: 

- `git@github.com:thehouseplant/future-rockstars.git`

Now, enter `cd future-rockstars` and then run the following commands to get a Python 3.6 environment configured to run the application in:

- `virtualenv env`
- On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate` 
- On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate.bat`

Now, when you look at your Command Prompt or terminal and you should see `(env)` in the prompt. This means that the Python environment has been activated and you can begin
installing dependencies for the project. For our purposes, all of our dependencies are stored in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed by running the following: 

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You now have all of the application code, Python environment, and application package dependencies installed. To make sure that the application is working, run the following command:

- `python ./run.py`
  - Note: If you run into permissions issues, run the following and then retry: `sudo chmod 755 ./run.py`

This will start the server and the application will be viewable at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Here is a complete list of commands for this application:
- To start the application, run the command `python ./run.py`
- To execute the test suites, run the command `python ./manage.py tests`
- To see a code coverage report, run the command `python ./manage.py coverage`
- To assign camp members to bands, run the command `python ./assign_bands.py`
- To assign dorm members to bands, run the command `python ./assign_dorms.py`

## Contribution Guide

- Clone this repository to your local machine with the command above and test that your environment can run it without issue before proceeding
- Once you've selected a user story to work on, be sure to add yourself as a member and move it into the "In Progress" column
- As you write new code, test it in your local environment and then make any required commits against the master branch
  - `git add [filenames]`
  - `git commit -m "[UserStory#] - What you changed in the code..."`
- Once you feel like the user story has been completed, perform a git push against the master branch
  - `git push -u origin master`
- The code will then be merged back into this repository and we can do reviews as necessary
- Before you begin a new user story, be sure to pull the latest code from the repository so that we do not run into conflicts
  - `git pull`
